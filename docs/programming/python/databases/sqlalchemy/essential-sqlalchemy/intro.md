SQLAlchemy Core VS ORM
---
The two modes use slightly different syntax, but the biggest difference between
Core and ORM is the view of data as schema or business objects. SQLAlchemy Core
has a schema-centric view, which like traditional SQL is focused around tables,
keys, and index structures, making it a good contender for applications like
data warehousing, reporting, etc.

ORM is much more suited for domain-driven design.
