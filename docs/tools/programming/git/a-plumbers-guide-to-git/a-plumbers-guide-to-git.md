Summary
---

- Git stores the contents of files as objects called blobs
- Git stores snapshots of the filesystem hierarchy in objects called trees,
  which point to blobs (individual files) and other trees (subdirectories)
- To build a sequential history and give context to snapshots, Git has objects
  called commits, which point to trees (the files and directories) and other
  commits (to build a history)
- Branches and refs are human-readable labels to specific commits

How porcelain uses plumbing behind the scenes
---

- git add is a combination of [[git-hash-object]] and update-index.
- git commit comes from
    - [[git-write-tree]]
    - [[git-commit-tree]]
    - if you’re on a branch, update-ref ([[git-refs]])
- git checkout uses update-ref or update-symbolic-ref ([[git-refs]])
