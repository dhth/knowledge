Exploring this wiki
---

A wiki is meant to be explored as fast as possible. The website has a few
keyboard shortcuts to move around quickly:

- `,`: Go to the previous post in sequential order
- `.`: Go to the next post in sequential order
- `s`: Search

On top of these shortcuts, I use [:fontawesome-solid-link:
Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) to navigate webpages using the keyboard.

Personally, I almost never begin a search from the website itself. I've built
- [[./tools/mac/alfred]]
page as quickly as possible.
