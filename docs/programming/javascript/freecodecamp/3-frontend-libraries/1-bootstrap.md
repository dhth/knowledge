# Bootstrap

## Center a heading

```html
<h2 class="text-center">your text</h2>
```

## Button

Normally, your `button` elements with the `btn` and `btn-default` classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. For example:

`<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>`

This button would only be as wide as the word "Submit".

Submit

By making them block elements with the additional class of `btn-block`, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.

`<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>`

This button would take up 100% of the available width.
