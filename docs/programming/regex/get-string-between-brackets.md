# Get string between brackets

Suppose you need to extract the string between two braces, eg.

```
- [[some-string]]
```

Regex to match it would be:

```
\[\[(.*?)\]\]
```

[[vimscript]] regex to extract it would be:

```vim
matchstr(getline('.'), '.*\[\[\zs.*\ze\]\]')
```

[vimscript]: ../../tools/programming/vim/vimscript/vimscript.md "VimScript"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
