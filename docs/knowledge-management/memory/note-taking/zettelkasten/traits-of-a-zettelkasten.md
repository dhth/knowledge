# Traits of a Zettelkasten

3 important traits:

 - It’s hyper-textual.
 - It adheres to the Principle of Atomicity.
 - It is personal.


Hypertextual
---

A Zettalkasten puts emphasis on forming relationships, ie, it makes connecting
-- not collecting -- a priority.

Atomic
---

Each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge and one only. Referring to an
atomic note is unambiguous: when you reference it, you will know what the
‘thought’ is. There should be no room for guesswork. That is what the rule of
atomicity means: Make sure that the layer of content and the boundaries between
notes match and are well defined. Then and only then can it be a reference to an
address identical to referencing a thought.

Personal
---

There is one Zettelkasten per person, and one person per Zettelkasten. Thinking
is a different process from communicating with another person. You want your
Zettelkasten to be a personal thinking tool.
