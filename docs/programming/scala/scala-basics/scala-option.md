Scala Option

Basics
---

From chapter 60 of [[functional-programming-simplified]]:

Think of `Option` as a box. Taking `Option[Int]` as an example, in the happy
case, `Option` delivers a `Some[Int]`, which can be thought of a box containing
an integer. Conversely, in the unhappy case, `Option` delivers a `None`, which
can be thought of an empty box.
