Timeline (WIP)
---

Sources: [[making-our-own-ping]]. 

1940s: Big computers like ENIAC. Used punch cards for input and output. Can only
compute one thing at a time, and be used by one person.

1960s: Efforts to connect different computers together were underway. Plans for
ARPANET published in 1967.

1969: [Telnet][2] emerges.

1970s: Time sharing becomes the dominant paradigm, allowing many humans to
use the same computer.

1973: [Ethernet][5] was developed at Xerox PARC between 1973 and 1974. It was
inspired by [Robert Metcalfe's][4] [ALOHAnet][6].

1977: A logical map of ARPANET [published][1].

1981: University of Southern California [comes][8] up with IPv4.

1983: Telnet transitioned to TCP/IP; this constituted the start of what we know
as "the modern internet".
