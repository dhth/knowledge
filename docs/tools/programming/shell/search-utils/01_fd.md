Powering FZF
---

`fd` can be used to power [fzf](../../vim/plugins/fzf.md) under the hood (both
in the shell, and in vim), by setting`$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`.

My `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is:

```bash
fd -iH
# i for ignoring case
# H for including hidden files
```

Ignore Files
---

fd has a `-E` flag for excluding files. For project specific configuration,
create a `.fdignore` file, and place the exclude patterns in it. For global
configuration, create a file at `~/.config/fd/ignore`.
