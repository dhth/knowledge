> I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing
> this." And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do
> that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take
> risks."


> NASA has this phrase that they like: "Failure is not an option." But failure
> has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.
> And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You
> have to be willing to take those risks. So, that's the thought I would leave
> you with, is that in whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is
> not.
