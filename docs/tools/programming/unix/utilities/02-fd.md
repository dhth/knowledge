Powering FZF
---

- [[../../vim/plugins/fzf]]
in the shell, and in vim), by setting`$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`.

My `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is:

```bash
fd -ipH -t f dir
# -i:   for ignoring case
# -H:   for including hidden files
# -p:   is search on the entire path, and not just the file name
# -t f: is to only search files (and not directories; gets annoying in Vim)
# dir:  where to search
```

Examples
---

```bash
fd -t d -I assets dir
# -t d:   is to only search directories
# - I:    ignore .fdignore file
# assets: the search term
```

Ignore Files
---

fd has a `-E` flag for excluding files. For project specific configuration,
create a `.fdignore` file, and place the exclude patterns in it. For global
configuration, create a file at `~/.config/fd/ignore`.

Easy copy from icloud to wiki folder
---

```bash
export WIKI_DIR="$HOME/Projects/knowledge"
export ICLOUD_DIR="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs"

alias ic2wiki='cp "$ICLOUD_DIR/export/$(ls $ICLOUD_DIR/export |fzf)" $(fd -t d -I assets '$WIKI_DIR' | fzf)'

# will copy from icloud/export to chosen wiki assets directory
```

Override .gitignore

/some_directory/*

# .fdignore
