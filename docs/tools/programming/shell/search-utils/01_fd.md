Powering FZF
---

`fd` can be used to power [fzf](../../vim/plugins/fzf.md) under the hood (both
in the shell, and in vim), by setting`$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`.

My `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is:

```bash
fd -ipH -t f
# -i for ignoring case
# -H for including hidden files
# -p is search on the entire path, and not just the file name
# -t f is to only search files (and not directories; gets annoying in Vim)
```

Ignore Files
---

fd has a `-E` flag for excluding files. For project specific configuration,
create a `.fdignore` file, and place the exclude patterns in it. For global
configuration, create a file at `~/.config/fd/ignore`.
