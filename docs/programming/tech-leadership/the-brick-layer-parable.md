Swizec is talking about engineers coming with the right attitude to solve
problems.

Taken directly from [this][1].

You come upon 3 bricklayers, ask them what they're doing, and get 3 responses.

- I'm laying bricks
- I'm building a wall
- I'm building a cathedral

The first bricklayer is the engineer who's a diligent worker, does what they're
told, and executes. Picks jira tickets off the board and gets them done few
questions asked. They're a great pair of hands, but not a brain.

The second bricklayer is that engineer who is lovely to work with. They'll ask
just enough questions to keep you honest, help you clarify requirements for a
story, and can make a great partner to the right product owner.

The third bricklayer is that engineer who companies rush to hire. They focus on
user outcomes and will rip requirements to shreds until they find the simplest
possible system that gets the job done. Looking 5 steps ahead this engineer is
on an equal footing with the product owner, a true partner. We're building a
cathedral, do we really need this wall?
