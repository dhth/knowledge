Why does this exist?
---

I've been writing reasonably well maintained notes on Notion for a while now.
Even though it's one of the best note taking tools out there, I didn't want to
be tied down to a specific platform for my wiki. On top of that, the lack of Vim
key bindings in Notion expedited the switch to simple markdown based notes.

The following infographic sums up my reasoning behind creating a wiki like this.

> This wiki might not make a ton of sense to an outsider, as I try to [write
notes for myself “by default,” and only “opt into” writing notes for an audience
explicitly](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J).
