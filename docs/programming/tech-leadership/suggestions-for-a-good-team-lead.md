From [this][1] post:

> - Learn how to delegate.
>
> - Understand motivation - google "Drive" by Daniel Pink
>
> - Consider cognitive load and ownership - google "Team Topologies"
>
> - Be very clear and repetitive about expectations: deadlines, performance,
>     metrics, whatever it might be. Tell your people up front what you want/need
>     from them. Be consistent with this, stick to your word. If you say one
>     thing and then do another, people will lose trust and leading will be
>     difficult.
>
> - Don't dump your problems on people below you. Gripes go up the chain.
>
> - Foster career development. Work with you team to figure out what they want,
>     explain what is necessary to get promotions/raises.
>
> - When bad things happen, bug gets pushed to prod or whatever, never throw your
>     team member under the bus. You take the heat for your team publicly.
>     Internally you can address issues with a person directly but publicly, in
>     front of management, you pay the cost to be the boss by taking
>     responsibility for what your team does.
>
> - Similarly, give credit to your team members when it is due. Hold up their
>     successes to management. Don't personally take credit for what someone on
>     your team did well.
>
> - Make decisions. Do not be indecisive. There can be some discussion about how
>     to solve a problem but ultimately someone has to decide and that should be
>     you.
>
> - Lead by example. get stuff done, handle your business, be successful. Your
>     team will emulate whatever you do, so do the right thing.
