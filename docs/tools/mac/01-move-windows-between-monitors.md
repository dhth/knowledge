There are many ways of doing this: using [Magnet][1], [Rectangle][2], or
Keyboard Maestro.

I'm using Magnet's `Next Display` and `Previous Display` commands (invoked via
Karabiner), but I think the same can be achieved with Rectangle.

This can also be done using Keyboard Maestro a macro like [this][3].
