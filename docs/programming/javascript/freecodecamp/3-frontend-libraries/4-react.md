React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.

For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: `{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }`. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.

However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.

One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.

This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.

For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.

Here's an example:

**Valid JSX:**

```javascript
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>
```

**Invalid JSX:**

```javascript
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>
```

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax `{/* */}` to wrap around the comment text.

## Difference between HTML and JSX

In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: `<div></div>`; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as `<br>` or as `<br />`, but should never be written as `<br></br>`, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as `<br />` in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A `<div>`, on the other hand, can be written as `<div />` or `<div></div>`. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the `<div />`. You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.

## Stateless Functional Component

Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a *stateless functional component*. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or `null`. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

```javascript
// After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'
const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};
```

Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.

## `React.Component`

The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 `class` syntax. In the following example, `Kitten` extends `React.Component`:

```javascript
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
```

This creates an ES6 class `Kitten` which extends the `React.Component` class. So the `Kitten` class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the `Kitten` class has a `constructor` defined within it that calls `super()`. It uses `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case `React.Component`. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the `class` keyword. It is best practice to call a component's `constructor` with `super`, and pass `props` to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.

## Component Composition

Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

To compose these components together, you could create an `App` parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the `render` method you could write:

```javascript
return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
```

When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in `< />` like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the `App` component and the `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects.

## `props`

In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an `App`component which renders a child component called `Welcome` which is a stateless functional component. You can pass `Welcome` a `user` property by writing:

```javascript
<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
```

You use **custom HTML attributes** created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property `user` is passed to the component `Welcome`. Since `Welcome` is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

```javascript
const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
```

It is standard to call this value `props` and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }, you have defined a location prop that's set to the string San Francisco, unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass null as the value for a prop, it will remain null.

### `proptypes`

React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set `propTypes` on your component to require the data to be of type `array`. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set `propTypes` when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a `propTypes` property for a component in the same way you defined `defaultProps`. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type `function` for a prop called `handleClick`:

`MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }`

In the example above, the `PropTypes.func` part checks that `handleClick` is a function. Adding isRequired tells React that `handleClick` is a required property for that component. You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that func represents function. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available.

Note: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: `import PropTypes from 'prop-types';`

### `this.props`

What if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the `this` keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called `data`, you write `{this.props.data}` in JSX.

## State

A *stateless functional component* is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A *stateless component*, on the other hand, is a class that extends `React.Component`, but does not use internal state. Finally, a *stateful component* is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.

One of the most important topics in React is `state`. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

You create state in a React component by declaring a `state` property on the component class in its `constructor`. This initializes the component with `state`when it is created. The `state` property must be set to a JavaScript `object`. Declaring it looks like this:

```javascript
this.state = {
  // describe your state here
}
```

You have access to the `state` object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. The `state`object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending `React.Component` in order to create `state` like this.

---

Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in `state`in its `render()` method. You can access the data with `this.state`.

If you want to access a state value within the `return` of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.

`State` is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.

Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its `state`. Its `state` is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as `props`. This notion of encapsulated `state` is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.

### `this.setState`

The previous challenges covered component `state` and how to initialize state in the `constructor`. There is also a way to change the component's `state`. React provides a method for updating component `state` called `setState`. You call the `setState`method within your component class like so: `this.setState()`, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a `username` in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

```javascript
this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
```

React expects you to never modify `state` directly, instead always use `this.setState()` when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the `setState` method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the `setState` method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind!

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({name:"React Rocks!"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

/*
There is a button element in the code editor which has an onClick() handler. This handler is triggered when the button receives a click event in the browser, and runs the handleClick method defined on MyComponent. Within the handleClick method, update the component state using this.setState().
*/
```

## Bind `'this'` to a Class Method

In addition to setting and updating `state`, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the `this` keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as `state` and `props`) inside the scope of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access `this`.

One common way is to explicitly bind `this` in the constructor so `this` becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have noticed the last challenge used `this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)` for its `handleClick` method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function like `this.setState()` within your class method, `this` refers to the class and will not be `undefined`.

## Using previous state to make updates to it

Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update. This means you can't rely on the previous value of `this.state` or `this.props` when calculating the next value. So, you should not use code like this:

```javascript
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
});
```

Instead, you should pass `setState` a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with `setState` guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. This means that the above should be rewritten as:

```javascript
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
  }
  toggleVisibility = function(state, props){
    this.setState((state, props) => ({
      visibility = !state.visibility
    }));
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
};
```

## Pass State as Props to Child Components

A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the `state`important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that `state`, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe you have an `App` component that renders a `Navbar`, among other components. In your `App`, you have `state` that contains a lot of user information, but the `Navbar` only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of `state` to the `Navbar` component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is *unidirectional data flow*. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

```javascript
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'CamperBot'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
         <Navbar name={this.state.name} />
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class Navbar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} </h1>
    </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Pass a Callback as Props

You can pass `state` as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under `this.props` in the child component.

---

There are three components outlined in the code editor. The `MyApp` component is the parent that will render the `GetInput` and `RenderInput` child components. Add the `GetInput` component to the render method in `MyApp`, then pass it a prop called `input` assigned to `inputValue` from `MyApp`'s `state`. Also create a prop called `handleChange` and pass the input handler `handleChange` to it.

Next, add `RenderInput` to the render method in `MyApp`, then create a prop called `input` and pass the `inputValue` from `state` to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the `input` field in the `GetInput` component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the `state` of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the `state` of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.

```javascript
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      inputValue: ''
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      inputValue: event.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
        <GetInput input={this.state.inputValue} handleChange={this.handleChange}/>
        <RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue}/>
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class GetInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Get Input:</h3>
        <input
          value={this.props.input}
          onChange={this.props.handleChange}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class RenderInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Input Render:</h3>
        <p>{this.props.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Lifecycle Methods

React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:`componentWillMount()` `componentDidMount()` `shouldComponentUpdate()componentDidUpdate()` `componentWillUnmount()` The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.

**Note:** The `componentWillMount` Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future version of 16.X and removed in version 17. [:fontawesome-solid-link: (Source)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html)

### `componentDidMount`

Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`. This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to `setState()` here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.

#### Event Listeners

The `componentDidMount()` method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as `onClick()`. React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.

Attach an event listener in the `componentDidMount()` method for `keydown` events and have these events trigger the callback `handleKeyPress()`. You can use `document.addEventListener()` which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.

Then, in `componentWillUnmount()`, remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to `document.removeEventListener()`. It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.

[:fontawesome-solid-link: EventTarget.addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

[:fontawesome-solid-link: Event reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: ''
    };
    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
  }
 
  componentDidMount() {
    document.addEventListener("keydown",this.handleKeyPress);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    document.removeEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress);
  }
  handleEnter() {
    this.setState({
      message: this.state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
    });
  }
  handleKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
      this.handleEnter();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### Optimize Re-Renders with `shouldComponentUpdate`

So far, if any component receives new `state` or new `props`, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new `state` or `props`, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is `shouldComponentUpdate()`, and it takes `nextProps` and `nextState` as parameters.

This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new `props`, even if the `props` haven't changed. You can use `shouldComponentUpdate()` to prevent this by comparing the `props`. The method must return a `boolean` value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (`this.props`) to the next props (`nextProps`) to determine if you need to update or not, and return `true` or `false` accordingly.

---

The `shouldComponentUpdate()` method is added in a component called `OnlyEvens`. Currently, this method returns `true` so `OnlyEvens` re-renders every time it receives new `props`. Modify the method so `OnlyEvens` updates only if the `value` of its new props is even. Click the `Add` button and watch the order of events in your browser's console as the lifecycle hooks are triggered.

```javascript
class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('Should I update?');
     if(nextProps.value % 2 == 0) return true;
     return false;
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component re-rendered.');
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>
  }
};

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 0
    };
    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);
  }
  addValue() {
    this.setState({
      value: this.state.value + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>
        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Conditional Rendering

### Using `&&`

You can use the `&&` logical operator to perform conditional logic in a concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is `true`, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

`{condition && <p>markup</p>}`

If the `condition` is `true`, the markup will be returned. If the condition is `false`, the operation will immediately return `false` after evaluating the `condition` and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing `&&` after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your `render()` method without repeating a lot of code.

### Using ternary operator

The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for `if/else` statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional `if/else` statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, `if/else` statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an `if/else` statement was required, it was always *outside* the `return` statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
