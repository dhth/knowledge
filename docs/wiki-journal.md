Current Goals
---

- [ ] Make reading notes back easier, so it forms a feedback loop. Might be good
    to look into [[spaced-repetition]]. 
- [ ] Track current goals better (solutions: tags (searched via ripgrep), a
    "now" page). Related to the feedback loop above; priority is to find it in
    vim faster, as opposed to finding it through the website.
