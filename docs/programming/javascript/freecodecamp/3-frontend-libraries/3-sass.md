# Sass

## Variables

One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.

In JavaScript, variables are defined using the `let` and `const` keywords. In Sass, variables start with a `$` followed by the variable name.

Here are a couple examples:

```scss
$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;

//To use variables:
h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}
```

## Nesting

Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

```scss
nav {
  background-color: red;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
}

nav ul li {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

```scss
nav {
  background-color: red;

  ul {
    list-style: none;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
    }
  }
}
```

## Mixins

In Sass, a *mixin* is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet.

Newer CSS features take time before they are fully adopted and ready to use in all browsers. As features are added to browsers, CSS rules using them may need vendor prefixes. Consider "box-shadow":

```scss
div {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
  -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
  -ms-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
}
```

It's a lot of typing to re-write this rule for all the elements that have a `box-shadow`, or to change each value to test different effects. Mixins are like functions for CSS. Here is how to write one:

```scss
@mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c){ 
  -webkit-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  -moz-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  -ms-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
}
```

The definition starts with `@mixin` followed by a custom name. The parameters (the `$x`, `$y`, `$blur`, and `$c` in the example above) are optional. Now any time a `box-shadow` rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called with the `@include` directive:

```scss
div {
  @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff);
}
```

## if-else

```scss
@mixin border-stroke($val){
  @if $val==light{
    border: 1px solid black;
  }
  @else if $val==medium{
    border: 3px solid black;
  }
  @else if $val==heavy{
    border: 6px solid black;
  }
  @else{
    border: none;
    }
}

#box {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: red;
  @include border-stroke(medium);
}
```

## `@for`

The `@for` directive adds styles in a loop, very similar to a `for` loop in JavaScript.

`@for` is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that the "start **to** end" *excludes* the end number as part of the count, and "start **through**end" *includes* the end number as part of the count.

Here's a start **through** end example:

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} { width: 100%/12 * $i; }
}
```

The `#{$i}` part is the syntax to combine a variable (`i`) with text to make a string. When the Sass file is converted to CSS, it looks like this:

```scss
.col-1 {
  width: 8.33333%;
}

.col-2 {
  width: 16.66667%;
}

...

.col-12 {
  width: 100%;
}
```

This is a powerful way to create a grid layout. Now you have twelve options for column widths available as CSS classes.

## `@each`

Sass also offers the `@each` directive which loops over each item in a list or map. On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

```scss
@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
```

A map has slightly different syntax. Here's an example:

```scss
$colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
```

Note that the `$key` variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. Otherwise, the compiled CSS would have `color1`, `color2`... in it. Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:

```scss
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}
```

## `@while`

The `@while` directive is an option with similar functionality to the JavaScript `while`loop. It creates CSS rules until a condition is met.

The `@for` challenge gave an example to create a simple grid system. This can also work with `@while`.

```scss
$x: 1;
@while $x < 13 {
  .col-#{$x} { width: 100%/12 * $x;}
  $x: $x + 1;
}
```

First, define a variable `$x` and set it to 1. Next, use the `@while` directive to create the grid system while `$x` is less than 13. After setting the CSS rule for `width`, `$x` is incremented by 1 to avoid an infinite loop.

## Partials

*Partials* in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (`_`) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the `.scss` file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the `@import` directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:

```scss
// In the main.scss file

@import 'mixins'
```

Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the `import` statement - Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to use.

## `@extend`

Sass has a feature called `extend` that makes it easy to borrow the CSS rules from one element and build upon them in another.

For example, the below block of CSS rules style a `.panel` class. It has a `background-color`, `height` and `border`.

```scss
.panel{
  background-color: red;
  height: 70px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}
```

Now you want another panel called `.big-panel`. It has the same base properties as `.panel`, but also needs a `width` and `font-size`. It's possible to copy and paste the initial CSS rules from `.panel`, but the code becomes repetitive as you add more types of panels. The `extend` directive is a simple way to reuse the rules written for one element, then add more for another:

```scss
.big-panel{
  @extend .panel;
  width: 150px;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

The `.big-panel` will have the same properties as `.panel` in addition to the new styles.
