```bash
	some_module_proj/
	├── [:fontawesome-solid-link: setup.py](http://setup.py/)
	└── some_module.py
```

The code we want to share is in `some_module.py`:

```python
# appendices/packaging/some_module_proj/some_module.py
def some_func():
   return 42
```

One directory with one module and a [:fontawesome-solid-link: setup.py](http://setup.py/) file is enough to make it installable via pip:

```python
# appendices/packaging/some_module_proj/setup.py
from setuptools import setup
setup(
	name='some_module',
	py_modules=[:fontawesome-solid-link: 'some_module']
)
```

```bash
$ cd /path/to/code/appendices/packaging
$ pip install ./some_module_proj
Processing ./some_module_proj
Installing collected packages: some-module
Running [:fontawesome-solid-link: setup.py](http://setup.py/) install for some-module ... done
Successfully installed some-module-0.0.0
And we can now use some_module from Python (or from a test):

$ python
Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04)
[:fontawesome-solid-link: GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin

>>> from some_module import some_func
>>> some_func()
42
>>> exit()
```

## Creating an Installable Package

Let’s make this code a package by adding an **init**.py and putting the **init**.py file and module in a directory with a package name:

```bash
$ tree some_package_proj/
some_package_proj/
├── [:fontawesome-solid-link: setup.py](http://setup.py/)
└── src
	 └── some_package
		 ├── **init**.py
		 └── some_module.py
```

The content of some_module.py doesn’t change. The **init**.py needs to be written to expose the module functionality to the outside world through the package namespace.

If we do something like this in **init**.py:

```python
import some_package.some_module
```

the client code will have to specify some_module:

```python
import some_package
some_package.some_module.some_func()
```

However, I’m thinking that `some_module.py` is really our API for the package, and we want everything in it to be exposed to the package level. Therefore, we’ll use this form:

```python
# appendices/packaging/some_package_proj/src/some_package/**init**.py
from some_package.some_module import *
```

Now the client code can do this instead:

```python
import some_package

some_package.some_func()
```

We also have to change the `setup.py` file, but not much:

```python
# appendices/packaging/some_package_proj/setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
	name='some_package',
	packages=find_packages(where='src'),
	package_dir={'': 'src'},
)
```

Instead of using `py_modules`, we specify `packages`.

This is now installable:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/code/appendices/packaging
$ pip install ./some_package_proj/
Processing ./some_package_proj
Installing collected packages: some-package
Running [:fontawesome-solid-link: setup.py](http://setup.py/) install for some-package ... done
Successfully installed some-package-0.0.0
and usable:

$ python
Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04)
[:fontawesome-solid-link: GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from some_package import some_func
>>> some_func()
42
```

Our project is now installable and in a structure that’s easy to build on. You can add a tests directory at the same level of src to add our tests if you want. However, the `setup.py` file is still missing some metadata needed to create a proper source distribution or wheel. It’s just a little bit more work to make that possible.

## Creating a Source Distribution and Wheel

For personal use, the configuration shown in the previous section is enough to create a source distribution and a wheel. Let’s try it:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/code/appendices/packaging/some_package_proj/
$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
running sdist
...
warning: sdist: standard file not found:
should have one of README, README.rst, README.txt

running check
warning: check: missing required meta-data: url

warning: check: missing meta-data:
either (author and author_email)
or (maintainer and maintainer_email) must be supplied

running bdist_wheel
...
$ ls dist
some_package-0.0.0-py3-none-any.whl some_package-0.0.0.tar.gz
```

Well, with some warnings, a .whl and a .tar.gz file are created. Let’s get rid of those warnings.

To do that, we need to:

- Add one of these files: README, README.rst, or README.txt.
- Add metadata for url.
- Add metadata for either (author and author_email) or (maintainer and maintainer_email).

The `setup.py`:

```python
appendices/packaging/some_package_proj_v2/setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
name='some_package',
description='Demonstrate packaging and distribution',

version='1.0',
author='Brian Okken',
author_email='brian@pythontesting.net',
url='[:fontawesome-solid-link: https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest'](https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest'%E2%80%8B),

packages=find_packages(where='src'),
package_dir={'': 'src'},
)
```

====================================================
some_package: Demonstrate packaging and distribution
====================================================

some_package is the Python package to demostrate how easy it is
to create installable, maintainable, shareable packages and distributions.

It does contain one function, called some_func().

.. code-block

>>> import some_package
>>> some_package.some_func()
42

That's it, really.

See [:fontawesome-solid-link: http://keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/) for some great advice on what to put in your change log. All of the changes to tasks_proj over the course of this book have been logged into a CHANGELOG.rst file.

Let’s see if this was enough to remove the warnings:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/code/appendices/packaging/some_package_proj_v2
$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
running sdist
running build
running build_py
creating build
creating build/lib
creating build/lib/some_package
copying src/some_package/**init**.py
 -> build/lib/some_package
copying src/some_package/some_module.py
 -> build/lib/some_package

running install_scripts
creating build/bdist.macosx-10.6-intel/wheel/some_package-1.0.dist-info/WHEEL

$ ls dist
some_package-1.0-py3-none-any.whl some_package-1.0.tar.gz
```

Now, we can put the .whl and/or .tar.gz files in a local shared directory and pip install to our heart’s content:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/code/appendices/packaging/some_package_proj_v2
$ mkdir ~/packages/
$ cp dist/some_package-1.0-py3-none-any.whl ~/packages
$ cp dist/some_package-1.0.tar.gz ~/packages
$ pip install --no-index --find-links=~/packages some_package
Collecting some_package
Installing collected packages: some-package
Successfully installed some-package-1.0
$ pip install --no-index --find-links=./dist some_package==1.0
Requirement already satisfied: some_package==1.0 in
/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages
```

Now you can create your own stash of local project packages from your team, including multiple versions of each, and install them almost as easily as packages from PyPI.
