Examples

### Move lines to end of file

```vim
:g/import/m$
" moves all lines containing the word 'import' to the end of the file
```

### Make the first word in a markdown list bold

Suppose we have the following list:

```
- word1 -- some text
- word2 -- some text
- word2 -- some text
```

`g` command to make the first word bold:

```vim
:.,$g/^-/norm! wi**^[wea**
```

Getting gq to behave nicely with lists

`:set fo-=q` seems to work. Needs more investigation.
